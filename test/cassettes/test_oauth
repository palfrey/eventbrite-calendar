        The Politics of MakingPanel\r\n\u201ca return to craft is as much an act of
        political resistance as it is an aesthetic choice.\u201d (Sinead Murphy, The
        Art Kettle)\r\nDigital technologies and the internet have changed the process
        of production, distribution and consumption, giving the amateur the same voice
        and means of production as commercial producers - the tools of production
        have gone through a process of democratization. Furthermore, the internet
        has given rise to the potential of global and mass collaboration. These developments
        are essentially possible through open structures and sharing.\r\nMaker culture
        makes use of these developments to invent, prototype and find unique uses
        and applications for technologies. Making and tinkering is not just a past
        time or a hobby however. It actively encourages the prising open of the black
        boxes of proprietary software and hardware. It engages more and more people
        in collaborative approaches. This panel aims to explore making as political
        act and asks is making (as part of maker culture) an act of political resistance
        with the potential to challenge pervasive processes of late capitalism?\r\nChaired

        \u2013 Making in Design EducationPanel\r\nThe advance of web based systems
        for collaboration sharing and the migration of once specialist systems of
        production to the desktop has bought about a situation where designers have
        joined makers, hackers, geeks, technologists, crafters and amateurs in common
        production environment where the distance between these groups has never been
        less.\r\nThis panel looks at how design education understands maker culture
        and it\u2019s inherent values and how it promotes and uses the ethos of maker
        culture as a methodology. It also looks at how maker culture understands what
        it does as distinctly different from the design professions.\r\nChaired by:

        \u2013 Break\r\n\r\n15:30 \u2013 Maker UrbanismPanel\r\nThis panel discussion
        considers existing and potential relationships between maker culture and grass
        roots urban activism and advocacy. Makers were famously described by Cory
        Doctorow as \"people who hack hardware, business-models, and living arrangements
        to discover ways of staying alive and happy even when the economy is falling
        down the toilet\" \u2013 the premise of this panel is to explore the implications
        of such practices in the spatial aggregate and to ask how they connect or
        could connect with urban structures, dynamics, and cultures.\r\nChaired by:

        \u2013 The Politics of Making<\/STRONG><BR>Panel<\/P>\r\n<P>\u201ca return
        to craft is as much an act of political resistance as it is an aesthetic choice.\u201d
        (Sinead Murphy, The Art Kettle)<\/P>\r\n<P>Digital technologies and the internet
        have changed the process of production, distribution and consumption, giving
        the amateur the same voice and means of production as commercial producers
        - the tools of production have gone through a process of democratization.
        Furthermore, the internet has given rise to the potential of global and mass
        collaboration. These developments are essentially possible through open structures
        and sharing.<\/P>\r\n<P>Maker culture makes use of these developments to invent,
        prototype and find unique uses and applications for technologies. Making and
        tinkering is not just a past time or a hobby however. It actively encourages
        the prising open of the black boxes of proprietary software and hardware.
        It engages more and more people in collaborative approaches. This panel aims
        to explore making as political act and asks is making (as part of maker culture)
        an act of political resistance with the potential to challenge pervasive processes
        of late capitalism?<\/P>\r\n<P>Chaired by: Dr. Eva Verhoeven Panelists: Cory

        \u2013 Making in Design Education<\/STRONG><BR>Panel<\/P>\r\n<P>The advance
        of web based systems for collaboration sharing and the migration of once specialist
        systems of production to the desktop has bought about a situation where designers
        have joined makers, hackers, geeks, technologists, crafters and amateurs in
        common production environment where the distance between these groups has
        never been less.<\/P>\r\n<P>This panel looks at how design education understands
        maker culture and it\u2019s inherent values and how it promotes and uses the
        ethos of maker culture as a methodology. It also looks at how maker culture
        understands what it does as distinctly different from the design professions.<\/P>\r\n<P>Chaired

        panel discussion considers existing and potential relationships between maker
        culture and grass roots urban activism and advocacy. Makers were famously
        described by Cory Doctorow as \"people who hack hardware, business-models,
        and living arrangements to discover ways of staying alive and happy even when
        the economy is falling down the toilet\" \u2013 the premise of this panel
        is to explore the implications of such practices in the spatial aggregate
        and to ask how they connect or could connect with urban structures, dynamics,
        and cultures.<\/P>\r\n<P>Chaired by: Rebecca Ross Panelists: Christian Nold,

        EXHIBITION TICKET INFORMATION:WHEN THE FREE DAYTIME TICKETS ARE ALL GONE THEN
        WE WILL STILL LET YOU IN WITHOUT A TICKET IF THE VENUE IS \u00a0NOT \u00a0TOO
        BUSY / FULL.\r\nAbout Radius:\r\nRadius\u00a0is more than just one event,
        it''s a\u00a0video games\u00a0festival\u00a0held in London in June 2014. It
        is the successor to last year''s hugely successful \u2018Etoo\u2019, born
        out of the idea to create an event for people to discover and explore new
        and interesting games. Presented directly by developers and designed to inspire
        people to engage, learn and interact with each other in a vibrant surrounding,
        it was like no other gaming event out there. Etoo 2013 was attended by\u00a0many\u00a0hundreds
        of people and received rave reviews across the international games press.
        We had an amazing array of games and guests at the Loading Bar in London,
        all thanks to your support. So much so that our friends, game developers,
        publishers and journalists, out in L.A. covering E3, were a little sad to
        miss out on the fun and excitement.\r\nThis is why with Radius we\u2019ve
        decided to host a series of events across two weeks: \u00a0From\u00a0\u201cRadius
        Loading\u201d (9th - 10th of June)\u00a0, the E3 media briefings party at
        the new Loading Bar in London Dalston, to\u00a0\u201cRadius Exhibition\u201d
        (19th - 21st of June) ,\u00a0our insipring games showcase at the White Space
        venue by Leicester Square, to\u00a0\u201cRadius Live Show\u201d (19th - 21st
        of June),\u00a0our streamed internet live show. And that\u2019s not even all.
        We have plans for more surprises that we will reveal later. Stay tuned!\r\nRadius
        is for everyone:\u00a0for people who love games, who are curious about the
        industry and who want to know more about developers and trends.\u00a0\r\nRadius
        continues what Etoo started, but one thing won\u2019t change: Radius will
        maintain the intimate and friendly atmosphere for developers, gamers and everyone
        who is enthusiastic about technology, creativity and gaming.\r\nUPCOMING RADIUS

        to go\u00a0until the General Election 2015 we''ve decided we should collectively
        get our act together and do something.\r\nIn 2010 7,000 non-partisan volunteers
        got together as Democracy Club and got stuck in doing a range of useful, simple
        activities like working out who all the candidates were, and collecting information
        about what they thought about major issues. But it was just an experiment,
        and one that was started a bit too close to the election to have much impact.\r\nIn
        2015 we want to do far better, and so we\u2019re starting far earlier. We
        want to form a community of people who just want the election to be better.

        mark International Transgender Day of Visibility.Friday 31 March is International
        Transgender Day of Visibility, which aims to celebrate transgender people
        and to raise awareness of the discrimination faced by the transgender community
        worldwide.\nNight before social for setupThe evening before the hackathon,
        coding bootcamp Makers Academy will be hosting a social for attendees who
        have registered for the hackday. The social will enable participants to meet
        and discuss ideas, in addition to working with our teams to support attendees
        in downloading necessary software and updates, to ensure time is fully utilised
        on the hackday itself. Please bring along your laptops and/or other devices
        you plan to use the following day.\u00a0While allies will be heartily welcomed
        to the social and the hackday, both events will be trans-positive and safe

        unique forms of discrimination, it is important to us that our event be not
        only safe and harassment free, but a positive and affirming space for everyone
        involved.We honour all gender identities, races, sexualities, body types,
        economic backgrounds, abilities, religious beliefs and overall ways of being

        in addition to working with our teams to support attendees in downloading
        necessary software and updates, to ensure time is fully utilised on the hackday
        itself. Please bring along your laptops and/or other devices you plan to use
        the following day.<BR>\u00a0<BR>While allies will be heartily welcomed to

        to displays that sustain modern society.\u00a0 In their practice of the art
        of building small, chemists have shown amazing success in the past decades.
        Moving from molecules to dynamic molecular systems the fundamental challenge
        is how to control and exploit motion at the nanoscale.\u00a0 \nAmong the major
        challenges ahead in the design of complex artificial molecular systems is
        the control over dynamic functions and responsive far-from-equilibrium behaviour.
        A major goal is to gain control over translational and rotary motion. In this
        presentation the focus is on my journey in the world of molecular switches
        and motors, the process of discovery and my personal experiences through my
        scientific career. In particular, I will address how fundamental questions
        and molecular beauty have guided me on this journey.\u00a0\u00a0\nBiography\nBen
        L. Feringa obtained his PhD degree at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands
        under the guidance of Professor Hans Wynberg. After working as a research
        scientist at Shell in the Netherlands and the UK, he was appointed lecturer
        and in 1988 full professor at the University of Groningen and named the Jacobus
        H. van ''t Hoff Distinguished Professor of Molecular Sciences in 2004. He
        was elected Foreign Honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
        He is a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences as well as a member
        of the Council of the Royal Society of Chemistry. In 2008 he was appointed
        Academy Professor and he was knighted by Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands.
        Feringa\u2019s research has been recognized with numerous awards including
        the K\u00f6rber European Science Award (2003), the Spinoza Award (2004), the
        Prelog gold medal (2005), the Norrish Award of the ACS (2007), the Paracelsus

        ACS Cope Scholar Award (2015), the Chemistry for the Future Solvay Prize (2015),
        the August-Wilhelm-von-Hoffman Medal (2016), The 2016 Nobel prize in Chemistry
        and the Tetrahedron Prize (2017). \nFeringa\u2019s research interest includes
        stereochemistry, organic synthesis, asymmetric catalysis, molecular switches
        and motors, self-assembly, molecular nanosystems and photopharmacology.\u00a0\nAbout
        the Schr\u00f6dinger Lecture\nThe Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger Lecture is an annual
        event named after the noted Austrian scientist. Schr\u00f6dinger was a theoretical
        physicist and a significant contributor to the wave theory of matter, a form
        of quantum physics. He mathematically devised an equation of wave mechanics
        that bears his name. He was a co-recipient of the 1933 Nobel Prize for physics.
        Today he is popularly known for the paradox of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat.\n\n\n",

        in clear and compelling prose that captured the imagination of many readers.
        It became the fastest-selling science book ever, selling 1.3 million copies
        worldwide.\r\nNow he returns with a new book, The Order of Time, which shows
        how our perception of time is fundamentally false. Time flows at a different
        speed in different places, the past and the future differ far less than we
        might think, and the very notion of the ''present'' evaporates in the vast
        universe. Rovelli draws together scientific theory, from Einstein to loop
        quantum gravity, as well as philosophy, literature and art, to illuminate
        our understanding of this mysterious subject.\r\nTickets are \u00a320, or
